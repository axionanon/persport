Initial problem: wrapped an image inside an anchor (<a>) tag. The draggable="false" attribute is set on the image, 
which should generally prevent the image from being draggable, but <a> might be interfereing with this since the image
leads to a link. To prevent drag while also allowing the link to function, we implement CSS styling: 
      <style>
        .no-drag {
          pointer-events: none;
        }
      </style>
Then we can add class="no-drag" withing our <img src> tag.
